    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mushroom masala is a classic Indian dish that is flavorful, warming, and simple to make. It is also known as "mushroom masala curry" or "mushroom curry". This recipe yields a curry that is pretty delicious over a bed of rice, accompanied by chapati, or even by itself. This is a purely vegetarian meal that is also vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1:</b><p>Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cinnamon, cumin seeds, green cardamom, cloves, star anise, and bay leaf. Stir to allow oil to absorb flavors and aroma, about 30 seconds.</p></li>
        <li><b>Step 2:</b><p>Stir in onion and saute until it becomes slightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Stir in ginger-garlic paste until smell diminishes, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and stir for 3 to 4 minutes. Add coriander powder, turmeric, and chili powder. Allow sauce to reduce, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in salt. Add mushrooms and stir until coated with sauce.</p></li>
        <li><b>Step 3:</b><p>Pour in water and allow mushrooms to cook in sauce until slightly soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in cashew powder and garam masala and let cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Break kasoori methi into fine pieces and stir into meal; remove from heat, and serve.</p></li>
